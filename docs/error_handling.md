Each error type has an associated Error() method that returns a formatted error message based on the error type and the provided error message. Additionally, there are corresponding New<ErrorType> functions that create and return an error instance with the specified error message.

To use these error types, you can import the `error` package and utilize the respective New<ErrorType> functions to create specific error instances when necessary.

Please note that it's important to handle and propagate errors appropriately in your code to ensure proper error handling and debugging.
