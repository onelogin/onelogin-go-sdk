## Code Structure

The SDK follows a modular structure with the following key components:

- `internal/api`: Contains the implementation of the API client, request handling, and response parsing.
- `internal/authentication`: Provides authentication mechanisms and related functionality.
- `internal/error`: Defines various error types used by the SDK.
- `internal/models`: Contains the model definitions used to represent data exchanged with the API.
- `internal/utilities`: Includes utility functions and helper methods.
- `pkg/onelogin`: Contains the main implementation of the OneLogin SDK.

## Getting Started
